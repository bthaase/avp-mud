101 AASSIGN~
Syntax: aassign <filename>.are  Example:  aassign edo.are
 
AASSIGN temporarily assigns all rooms, objects, and mobiles in the area
range to your pfile.  This allows you to use rlist, olist, mlist, and
reset list.  This also means that typing savearea, reset area, or 
instazone will affect this area.  
 
To save changes permenantly, type "aassign none" and foldarea.
 
Warning!! Do not have an area aassigned to yourself when getting personal
vnums assigned to you.  The personal vnums will overwrite the area file.
 
In order to assign a proto area to yourself, you must either have that
area bestowed to you or you must be Greater God+.
 
In order to assign a nonproto area to yourself, you must either have
that area bestowed to you by a member of the Area Council or you must
be Exalted+. Even if you have the area bestowed to you, only Lesser+
can assign themselves nonproto areas.

101 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

101 ADVANCEDEXITS~
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction,
as well as the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.
 
If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one,
use a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to
refer to it by number:
redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
 
To know what number an exit is, do an "rstat".
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one
of the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It is also usually a good
idea to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
If a player types 'swim' in the room, they will move to room 3001.

0 AFFECTED 'AFFECTED BY'~
Syntax:  affected       (abbrevation:  af)
Syntax:  affected by    (abbreviation: af by)
 
'Affected' is a powers-at-a-glance function, which displays only the powers
(and skill affects) your character is currently under.  Each affect will be
listed by name only for the sake of brevity (if you want to know what each
is doing, use help <power/skill name> or 'score').
 
Characters level 20 or above and deadly characters will also see the number
of rounds remaining for each affect.  Affects with a remaining lifespan of
less than 25 rounds are displayed in white, and those in immediate danger
of wearing off will flash.
 
'Affected by' displays a character's affects separate from its power/skill
affect list.  This is useful for ensuring that affects given from equipment
are actually functioning.  For example, if you are wearing a visor with
detect_invis but 'affected by' does not show you as having that affect, you
are not detecting invisibility.
 
'Affected by' also displays your current susceptibilities, resistances and
immunities if your character is level 20 or higher.
 
~

101 AFFECTEDBY AFFECTED_BY~
The following are affect flags that can be used when osetting an item
(with oset <item> affect affected <affect flag>).  These flags can also

101 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax:  allow <site>
Syntax:  ban   <site>
Syntax:  ban
Syntax:  ban <# of ban on ban list> level <level of char to ban and below>
 
BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.
 
BAN with no arguments returns an enumerated list of banned sites.
 
To set a specific level of character to ban from a site, use 'ban' to get
the list number of the banned site and then use 'ban level'.
Example:  ban 2 level 10
 
This will ban all characters level 10 and under from the second site on
the 'ban' list.
 
ALLOW <site> removes a site from the ban list.
 
The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

1 COMBAT~
You may choose a fight by finding a mob, and using LOOK, CONSIDER, and
IDENTIFY to gauge the difficulty of the opponent.  You can LOOK <mob>
to get a look at its equipment and description, this will often help
indictate how hard a fight might be.  You can CONSIDER <mob> for a one
on one comparison of the mobs hitpoints and level to your own.  You may
also FEEL IDENTIFY <mob> to get more detailed information about the mob
if you have force ability.
 
You may start a fight by using KILL, MURDER, or many powers and skills
available to players.  The easiest way to start a fight is to KILL <mob>.
Currently, you may also MURDER <mob>, but this causes the mob to yell out.
 
You may find yourself in trouble during a fight, and wish to leave, this
can be done by using FLEE or RECALL.  You can flee a fight by typing FLEE.
You may recall from a fight with the power 'word of recall' or by reciting
a recall scroll.  You may also set it up to flee automatically once you go
below a certain number of hitpoints by using WIMPY.  To use your wimpy, type
WIMPY or WIMPY <number of hitpoints>.  Leaving a fight with wimpy, flee, and
recall WILL cost you a loss of experience, with recall causing the greatest
loss.

1 'CONTAINERS' 'CONTAINER'~
Containers are almost a necessity in the game.  They are used to carry
items, food, and drinks.  They help allow you to sort things, by using two
or more types of containers at once.  Corpses use many of the same commands
as regular containers.

EXAM <container> or LOOK IN <container> allows you to see what it contains.

GET <item> <container> allows you to take one item from a container.
GET ALL <container> allows you to take everything from a container at once.
GET ALL.<item> <container> allows you to take all of a particular item type

PUT <item> <container> puts an item inside a container.
PUT ALL <container> will put as much of your inventory in the container as
possible, until the container is full.
PUT ALL.<item> <container> will put as much of one type of item into the
container as possible, until the container is full.

the AC of the item is damaged by one.  If the AC on an item is 5, after it
is damaged more than five times it will be destroyed or scraped.
 
If you wish to preserve the equipment, you must repair it by taking it to
the town blacksmith. (NOTE:  Not all equipment is repairable)  You may also
notice that while fighting a creature which attacks you with acid breath or

~

101 EXITMAKING~
The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
For more than one exit in the same direction see ADVANCEDEXITS.

The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
redit exit n                - Removes the north exit

See EXITTYPES for generating the exit-type value.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

101 EXITTYPES~
These are the currently valid exit-types:
      0 - Plain exit
      1 - Door exists         (Required to be closed or locked)
      2 - Door is Closed
      4 - Door is Locked
      8 - Door is Secret      (Trying to go that way won't reveal door)
     32 - Door is Pickproof   (Door can't be picked by power or skill)
     64 - Need to be able to fly to go that way
    128 - Need to be able to climb to go that way
   1024 - Door is Passdoor proof

NOTE: You must ADD the values together to generate an exit-type:
        3 = a closed door
        7 = a closed and locked door
       11 = a closed secret door
       15 = a closed, locked and secret door

-- Use the 'redit exflags' command to change these flags, and to set the
   advanced exit flags, most of which are not shown above.

See EXFLAGS and EXITMAKING.
~

0 FIELD CHARGE 'FIELD CHARGE'~
&w&zField Charge is incredibly important to a Predator. Most of his systems
rely around this sole source of energy. On its own, Field Charge
replenishes very slowly. The 'Energy Sift' device can speed this process
up considerably. (&w&BSee HELP ENERGY SIFT&z)
 
The Predator's Cloaking Device uses up field charge in small amounts. When
it runs out, they will decloak and become visible. 
 
Some energy-based weapons drain directly from a Predator's field charge
also. For instance, the Energy Pistol and the Scatter Gun both cost field
charge to fire the weapon. The advantage is, you dont have to purchase
ammo. The disadvantage is making sure you have enough charge left. 
 
Also, the Predator Medicomp healing device drains an immense amount of
field charge when used, generally draining you dry. You always want to use
the Medicomp in combination with the Energy Sift to make sure your not
caught without field charge. 
 
&w&RSee Also: HELP ENERGY SIFT, HELP CLOAK, HELP MEDICOMP
~

1 FIRE~
&RSyntax: &GFIRE &C<&cdirection&C> &C<&c# rooms&C>&z

~

0 FIXCHAR~
Syntax:  fixchar <character>
 
Resets a character's saving throws and mentalstate.  Should probably
not be done while the character is equipped.
~

101 'FLOAT'~
Syntax:  cast 'float' <character>
 
The power enables the target character to float.  It is useful in saving
mv (movement points), as well as in preventing damage taken when falling
and in preventing an opponent from tripping you.  It does not allow you
to travel through areas which require you to fly, however.
~

0 FLY~
Syntax:  cast 'fly' <character>
 
This power enables the target character to fly.  It is useful in saving
mv (movement points), preventing a character from falling when in the
air, moving over water or through the air, and in preventing an opponent
from tripping you.
 
Some water areas require the use of fly to prevent damage from drowning.
If you are in an area and your movement suddenly begins to drop, then you
begin losing hps <hitpoints>, you should cast fly immediately.
~

101 FOLDAREA~
Syntax:  foldarea <area filename>
 
This command is used to save a live (non-prototype) area file, usually after
it has been modified.  It should be used with extreme care.
 
See ASET, UNFOLDAREA and INSTALLAREA.
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>; Syntax: group <character>; Syntax: group
 
'Follow' starts you following another character.  To stop following, type
'follow self'.  You cannot follow those more than ten levels above you.
 
'Group <character>' adds someone who is following you into your group, making
them a group member.  Group members share experience from kills, and may use
the GTELL and SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will
automatically join the fight.
 
If character is already a member of your group, using 'group <character>'
will remove them from your party.  Removing the character from the group
does not stop them from following you, however.  A character can also
leave your group by using the 'follow self' command, in which case they
will both leave your group and stop following you.
 
'Group' with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
 
You may follow lower level characters or characters up to ten levels higher.
You may group only characters within eight levels of your own.
 
'Group all' groups all eligible players following you in the room.
 
'Group disband' allows a leader to disband his group (members stop following
 and are ungrouped).
~

101 FOR~
Syntax:  for <argument> <command>
Syntax:  for <argument> <command> <target>
 
For allows an immortal to perform a command at or even on a large
number of targets.  The arguments include:  all, mobs, gods.
 
Example:  for gods gl, you will 'glance' in the room of every god
who is online (include link-dead)
 
You can also perform an action on the argument target.
Example:  for mobs poke #, you will perform the 'poke' social on
every mob in the game.
 
'For' does not override private flags.
~

101 FORCE~
Syntax:  force <victim> <command>
Syntax:  force all <command>
 
Force forces one mob or character to execute a command.
 
FORCE 'all' forces _all_ everywhere in the game to execute a command,
typically used for 'force all save'.
 
Note that the level required to use force on mobs can be different
than the level required to use force on players, and can be adjusted
via 'cset' (see 'help cset').
 
~

101 FORCECLOSE~
Syntax: forceclose <descriptor>

This command will force a certain descriptor to close.
This is useful to disconnect connections that aren't really connected
due to a poor TCP connection.

It can also be used to forceclose a connection before a potential
problem player can even get to the authorization state of connection.

See USERS, CONSTATES and DISCONNECT.
~

101 FQUIT~
Syntax:  fquit <character>
 
Can be used by low-level imms to force a level 1 player to quit the game,
for example if the player is accidentally authorized or is causing problems
and there are no higher immortals around to deal with the problem.  Fquit
does not work on any player higher than level 1.

1 GRENADE GRENADES LOB THROW ARM~
&RSyntax: &GARM &C<&cdelay time&C>&z
&RSyntax: &GLOB &C<&cdirection&C> &C<&c# of rooms&C>&z

This will let you use grenades against your enemies, or even friendlies.
~

1 GRIP~
This skill is automatic, once practiced.  The skill causes you to grip
your weapon tightly as someone tries to disarm you, making it far more
difficult to successfully disarm you.  This skill will only increase as
you are engaged in fights where someone is attempting to disarm you.
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>
 
All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.
 
SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.
 
TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.
 
REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

101 HEDIT~
Syntax:  hedit [help topic]
 
This command allows you to edit a help topic.  If the specified help topic
does not exist, it will be created for you.  The default help page (summary)
will be selected if you do not specify a page.
 
NOTE - Always, when creating a new help entry, type Help <new entry name>
       prior to creating your entry. A pre-existing help file associated
       with that keyword may already exist.
&Y
Colors &wcan now be added to help files using the same command set that changes
a player prompt.  &bMultiple &Ycolor &wcombinations can be set on a given line
including ^bbackground^x colors.  However, there are a couple of quirks to take
note of:
&Y
    1) If the first line of your help file containers a color code and you are
       experiencing a display problem with the file, use a . to begin the file.
    2) Color changes should be separated by at least one character.  Example:
       '&&Y.^^r' will work, '&&Y^^r' may cause problems.
 
See HSET, PCOLORS.
~

101 HELL UNHELL~
Syntax: hell <character> <number> <hours or days>
Syntax: unhell <character>
 
The hell command sends a character to hell for a given period of time.  It
automatically releases the character when their time has been served.  Upon
being helled, the character receives the message, "The immortals are not 
pleased with your actions.  You shall remain in hell for <time period>."
 
Hell takes arguments of either hours or days.  To hell someone for 3 hours,
"hell <character> 3 hours."  To hell someone for three days, "hell <character>
3 days".  Hell will default to hours if hours or days is not specified.

To release a player from hell early, simply "unhell <character>".

100 HELPFILE FILE HELPFILES~
To edit/make a help file there are some basic and yet confusing
commands
necessary.  So here we go...
hedit <helpfile>
hset level 1 <helpfile>
hset keyword "<word list>" <helpfile>
hset save <helpfile>
~

1 HIDE~
&RSyntax: &GHIDE
&w
This will allow you to appear to not be in the room if an enemy comes
walking in or scans into the room. The exception to this is the alien
race. Because of their nature, they are able to see any hidden enemies.

When used, your movement guage will lose 2 bars. Any movement or firing
that you do will cancel out hide. As well, you are unable to hide if an
enemy is in the same room as you.
~

1 HIVE HIVING HIVES HIVED~
&w&BHives and Hiving: &z 
Hives are the backbone of the Alien species. To be quite frank, aliens
generally suck on their own, even in swarms and groups. Their low hitpoints
and short range attacks lower their effectiveness considerably. 
 
To compensate, aliens are able to hive most indoor rooms, converting them
into alien nesting areas. Hived rooms provide TONS of benifits for aliens
inside them. They include: 

&G* &zAliens in the room gain sneak. (&WEnemies dont see you enter/leave&Z)
&G* &zAliens in the room have faster hitpoint recovery. 
&G* &zAliens in the room recover their skills twice as fast. 
&w&G* &zMarines get a 10% penalty to accuracy. 
&G* &zMarines moving around in the hive take hits to their morale. 
 
As you can see, Hives are a huge benifit to aliens are will likely save
their asses in a lot of tight situations. Now for the important stuff:
Aliens hive rooms using the HIVE Command. Marines can clear the rooms
using the DEHIVE Command, naturally. 
 
&w&RNote: Marines using flamethrowers can clear rooms faster than normal.
~

1 HLIST~
Syntax: hlist <low level range> <high level range>
 
This command will give you a listing of available help files. The list
is in alphabetical order based on the first triggering keyword. While
this command was initially designed as a maintenance tool to help us
track help files, it is also available to players so that they can
capture a listing of the help files available to them. 
 
Note - You may only view help files that are coded for viewing by your
       level or lower.
 
Note - The list of help files is quite extensive, and the command does
       not as yet have a way to filter/shorten the list. Screen capture
       is, at present, your only recourse.
 
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax:  hold   <object>
Syntax:  remove <object>
Syntax:  remove all
Syntax:  wear   <object>
Syntax:  wear   all
Syntax:  wield  <object>
 
Three of these commands will cause you to take an object from your inventory
and use it as equipment:
 
HOLD is for lights, wands and staves; WEAR is for armor; WIELD is for weapons.
 
You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.
 
WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD/WEAR/WIELD each suitable item in inventory.
 
REMOVE will take an object from your equipment and place it into inventory.
 
REMOVE ALL will remove all your equipment and place it into inventory.
 
~

101 HOLYLIGHT INVIS~
Syntax: holylight
Syntax: invis

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which 
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (51) for INVIS 51.  A 
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will 
say (Invis 51).

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.
~

1 'HP'~
This is an abbreviation for hit points.  All classes begin with 20 hp
at creation and gain between 6 and 19 hp per gained level, depending on
class, race and CON.  Equipment can also add to your total hp.
~

101 HSET~
Syntax:  hset  <command> [value] [help topic]
 save                            Saves all help pages (to help.are)
 level <level> <help topic>      Sets help topic to specified level
 keyword <keyword> <help topic>  Sets help keyword to specified keyword
 remove <level.><help topic>     Removes the specified help page
 
Note:  If you wish to set more than one keyword to a help topic, enclose all
       the keywords, space separated inside quotes.  (Like in powercasting)
Note:  If you have instances of multiple help files with the same keyname,
       using Hset Remove without a level designation will remove the one with
       the lowest level of access. ie:
 
       Help file XYZZY at level 57, and help file 'SAVE XYZZY' at level 58.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE XYZZY' will remove the level 57 XYZZY.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE 58.XYZZY' will remove the level 58 'SAVE XYZZY'.

0 INFRAVISION~
Syntax: feel infravision <character>

This power enables the target character to see other players and mobiles
that are in the room with them.  This power will also allow you to get
items from a corpse, but will not allow you to see the corpse.  You
must have a light source to see items, room descriptions, or "exits" in
a dark room.
~

101 INSTALLAREA~
Syntax:  installarea <area filename> <full area name/title>
 
Installs a prototype area into the mud as a non-prototype area.  The
filename can be fixed with aset (don't forget to foldarea afterwards).
 
Installarea renames the installed area file from 'author.are.file' to
'author.are.installed' so that the builder may be assigned new vnums.
 
~

101 INSTAROOM INSTAZONE~
Syntax:  instaroom
 
Functions the same as instazone, but is room-based instead of area-based.
 
Syntax:  instazone [nodoors]
 
This command lets your instantly create a whole set of resets for your area
based on all the mobiles and objects contained within your area.
All you have to do is place each mob in its proper room, wearing what it
should be wearing, carrying what it should be carrying, and objects in their
proper places, or in their proper containers, and doors in their proper
states, (open, closed, locked).  The instazone command will clear out your
current resets (if any), and create new ones for you.
You may optionally specify "nodoors" so that door resets will not be
created.
 
NOTE:  This command will wipe out any existing resets!  Do not use this
command after you have added your own resets with 'reset add'.
The recommended procedure is to use instazone, then use the 'reset' command
to add any special resets, and NOT use instazone again.
 
See RESET and RESETCMDS.

.
&gLayers are currently available on the following wear locations:
 
&GAbout, Arms, Body, Feet, Hands, Legs, Waist.
 
&gLayers are set with a numeric value, or combination of values.  The lower
the value, the lower the layer, or thinner the item of clothing/armor is.
 
Valid numeric values are:
 
&G0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
 
&gOr any combination of the above. A value of zero means no other items came
be layered with this item. Items of clothing can be layered over one another
as long as their layer values do not overlap. ie, if leather armor were set
to a value of 56 (8, 16, and 32), it could not layer with, say, a set of
heavy chain that is set to a value of 96 (32 and 64), as they overlap on the
layer value of 32.

Syntax:  log   <character>
Syntax:  log   all
Syntax:  snoop <character>
 
LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into the
server's log file and to the log channel.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent
character toggle that persists across reboots until removed.
 
Certain commands (such as password) are protected against LOG.  Conversely,
certain commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.
 
LOG ALL logs all character and mob commands and actions to the server's log
file, but does not send the output to the log channel.  It is a server-wide
toggle; it does not persist across reboots.
 
SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.  The
character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one character
at a time.  The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the
players  name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)
 
SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.

1 MARINE_BASE_WALKTHROUGH~
&BThe following is a walkthrough of the Marine players starting base.  

&CGeneral Equipment:
&YWhen you first enter Alien vs Predator : Legends, if you chose the Marine
class, you will find yourself in a somewhat large and confusing base. To
begin with, lets show you were to find your standard devices such as
lights and grenades. Now, to get to the General Equipment room. Go 1 room
east, then 1 room north. Here you will find your motion tracker, radio,
gps system, grenades, flashlights, and other little tidbits.

&CArmor and Weapons
&YNow, from there, to get your armor, You go south 1 room, the east 1, then
1 room north. Here you will find the armor available to Marines. Each
piece of armor gives a diffrent amount of protection in different fields.
To find your standard light weapons, pistols, pulse rifle, etc, You will
need to go south 1, then east 1. Here you find your light guns. To find
your heavier guns, like the Sniper rifles, Shotguns, and the Minigun, you
can go west 1, then south 1.

&CMedical Supplies
&YFor your skills such as Basic and Advanced Medical, you will need to pay
a visit to the MEdical wing of the base. To get there, you will need to
return to the spawn room. Remember the first room you saw? Just retrace
your steps to get back. Now, to get to the medical wing, we will need to
go 2 rooms to the north and 3 rooms to the west.  Here you can buy
painkillers, which heal you somewhat, but will degrade if not used, and
you can get the Bandages needed for Basic Medical, and the Medical Kits
used for Advanced Medical.

&GLeaving the base and Entering the Combat
&RWhen leaving the base and entering the combat arena, its a good thing to
look at the TIME to see if you will need a flashlight or not. If the time
is after 6AM and before 7PM, then its daylight, and you don't need a
flashlight immediatly. To get to the DEPLOYment zone, you need to return to
the central room, the first room you were in, and you will need to go
SOUTH twice, then east, and possibly open the south door. Otherwise, go
south, then west. To leave the base and finally enter the arena, use the
DEPLOY command to see your available DEPLOYment zones. Just use DEPLOY <#>
to enter the field. You can return at anytime by returning to the room you
deployed to and using the DEPLOY command again.

The morale meter, located under your SCORE display, is a rather important
meter to watch. If it ever is completly empty, then you will be frozen
still, or scared sh*tless as some put it, and you won't be able to move
for a certain length of time. There are Marine skills to passivly increase
this as well. The morale meter will go down or up, depending on things
that happen to you while playing.

actions deemed questionable.

If this policy is violated, both characters are subject to a slay.

-1 M_BALZHUR_~
Suddenly out of nowhere, a hideous beast appears, bringing with it the
horrible smell of brimstone, death and decay!

The demon gives you the most evil and spine tingling sneer that makes you
fall to your knees, and release your bladder... 

The next second, the immense mass of slimey muscle and claws is all over you
...shredding you to a bloody mess!

Mercifully, everything goes black as it moves its widening maw towards your
head...

-1 M_GODLVL1_~

You feel yourself leaving your body... rising up into the air, you feel
indeed much more free than you have ever felt before...

You float high into the heavens... a vortex of ever-changing curved beams
of colored light swirling around you faster and faster...

Your soul is bursting with emotions you can barely conceive...
You feel a burning inside... both cold and hot... a tingle of electricity
grows into a powerful buzzing surge jolting through every inch of your body.

A strange chorus of voices begins to sing indecipherable and long forgotten
words... the singing grows louder and louder... a million voices as one.

You feel yourself losing touch with reality... and all goes quiet.
~

-1 M_GODLVL2_~
...You begin to feel light-headed.

Your hands begin to tingle softly...
The feeling quickly grows into a strange radiating pulse of energy! 

The tingle rises up your arms and into your head, filing your mind with
visions of worlds of wonder, far off places, great towers, vast mountains,
oceans, seas, lush valleys, dark caverns and twisted passages...
 
You sense a feeling of wonderous potential and power in your hands...
Enough power to build and create these visions for yourself!

You feel much more powerful, eager and inspired!

-1 M_GODLVL3_~
...You feel slightly faint as your head begins to spin.

Your hands begin to tingle once more...
A vortex of energy starts to swirl throughout your hands, going faster
and faster... becoming almost painful! 

Beams of light break through your skin, one at a time, then more and
more until the light is almost to bright to bear...

As your squint your eyes, you perceive a vision of great beasts of wonder,
dangerous and unnatural fiends, pixies, faeries, tribes and clans, peoples
of all kinds, ancient forgotten artifacts, weapons of vast untapped powers,
crystal balls, magick rings, staves, wands, rods, arcane tomes of untold
secrets... your mind is bursting with inspiration...
 
You sense a new, reborn feeling of unlimited potential and power...
In your hands the power to build and create these visions for yourself!

The bright light from your hands fades away... but strange faint glow
remains always.

100 NOKILL KILL NO~
A 'nokill' flag has been added for NAMED mobs. It doesn't make sense
for some mobs to die and then suddenly be back alive again ( the ones
with names as opposed to ones like anonymous stormtroopers etc ).
This flag will cause the mob that has it to appear to flee before it
dies... It will still give experience but won't leave a corpse lying
around. 
 
use: mset <mob#> flags nokill

NOTE LIST lists notes which you can read.  NOTE READ reads one or all notes.
By specifying a number after NOTE LIST, you will list all notes including
and after that number.

NOTE SUBJECT sets the subject line of a new note.  NOTE TO sets the list of
recipients.  The recipient ALL means all players, and the recipient IMMORTAL
means all immortals.

NOTE WRITE puts you into edit mode, where you can easily enter your note
with use of some simple editor commands:
            /? - help    /s - save    /l - list    /c - clear

NOTE SHOW shows your note in progress; NOTE CLEAR starts over.

NOTE POST posts your note for reading.  Posting is not automatic.

NOTE REMOVE removes the entire note if you are the sender, or just removes you
from the to-list if you are a recipient.

NOTE TAKE takes the note as in NOTE REMOVE, as well as physically taking 
it in your inventory.

Notes now require a blank message disk to record :)

NOTITLE, NOEMOTE, NOTELL, and SILENCE are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from setting their title, emoting, telling, and using
channels, respectively.  Characters who are notelled will also not recieve
those forms of communication.

~

101 OLIST~
Syntax: olist
      :	olist <first object>
      :	olist <first object> <last object>

This command will list all of the prototype objects in your area, when used 
with no arguments.  When used with a single argument it will list all 
objects including and after the argument, and when used with two arguments, 
it will list all objects including and between the two. 
~

101 OMENU~
The menu commands are no longer in operation.

~

101 OPEDIT~
Syntax:  opedit <object> <command> [number]  [program] [arguments]
Syntax:  opedit <object> add       <program> <arguments>
Syntax:  opedit <object> insert    <number>  <program> <arguments>
Syntax:  opedit <object> edit      <number>  [program] [arguments]
Syntax:  opedit <object> delete    <number>
Syntax:  opedit <object> list
 
Add, insert and edit will put you into the line editor to edit your program.
The arguments consist of a trigger, plus any arguments associated with that
trigger.  Object programs are like mobprograms, with trigger differences.
 
To edit an Objprogram, you must be holding the object in your inventory.
 
See OPSTAT, TRIGGER, OPTRIGGERS, OPCOMMANDS, IFCHECKS, IFCHECKS2, VARIABLES
~

0 OPEN CLOSE LOCK UNLOCK PICK~
Syntax: open   <object|direction>
Syntax: close  <object|direction>
Syntax: lock   <object|direction>
Syntax: unlock <object|direction>
Syntax: pick   <object|direction>

OPEN and CLOSE open and close an object or a door.

LOCK and UNLOCK lock and unlock a closed object or door.  You must have
the requisite key to LOCK or UNLOCK.

PICK can open a lock without having the key.  In order to PICK successfully,
you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

101 OPSTAT~
Syntax: opstat <object/object vnum>
 
Opstat will display all of the objprograms that have been written for the
specified object.  If a copy of the object exists in the game, it can be
accessed by its vnum.
 
See OPEDIT, TRIGGER, OPTRIGGERS, OPCOMMANDS, IFCHECKS, IFCHECKS2 VARIABLES
~

101 OSET~
Syntax:  oset <object>    <field> <value>
         oset object on
 
If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.
 
Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.
 
If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.
 
OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object.  Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply 'oset <object>'.  Hitting enter while in OSET ON gives
you an ostat of the object you are working on.  To get out of OSET ON, simply
type the word DONE. Example:
 
        oset staff on
        long A long gnarled staff of burnished oak lies here.
        type staff
        done

103 PLAYERS~
When people talk to you, you do not automatically know their name. You can
'remember' their voices, but if you have bad memory ic'ly, you can
'forget' them as well. Imperial databases can track a person down simply
with voice recognition, as long as they receive the proper message and go
through proper IC channels. Otherwise, no one else knows a person's name
unless that person introduces themselves. Any other notion is bad RP, and
will be called upon, and can be reported.   Ships owners when using the
info command on a ship on the ground or in space is strictly OOC, unless
you are Imperial, because the Empire can search ship purchase database,
you cannot just yell "There's a rebel ship on Tralus", simply because it
says "Rebel Transport, owner The Rebel Alliance." That would be a cause
for bad RP, and can be called upon for an OOC basis and will disagreeably
unfair. In short, unless the person tells you, shows you, or acknowledges
his or her name, or property, you do not, IC'ly know any information about
them, bios for viewing can only be known for Imperial usage IC'ly as well,
any bios may not be used IC'ly unless you are part of the Empire,
preferably the Officer Corps of the Empire, as that is better RP than
enlisted rankings.

~

1 QUIT~
.
Syntax: QUIT

QUIT leaves the game. In an effort to provide realism in SWLC you may only
quit the game from certain safe resting places. There are several of these
throught the game - most are clearly marked.              
~

1 RADIO~
&RSyntax: &GRADIO &C<&cmessage&C>&w
&RSyntax: &C<&c#1-4&C> &C<&c#1-4&C>&w

you must enter the menu number, followed by a space, then the radio
message number. It will then send the message to all Marines with
radios.
~

101 RASSIGN MASSIGN OASSIGN~
Syntax:  rassign <character> <begin vnum range> <end vnum range>
 
These commands allow you to assign a range of vnums to an immortal for
so that they may build inside that range.  Use the 'checkvnums' command
before assigning a range to ensure that there will be no vnum conflicts.
You can also use the 'vnums' command for a complete list of currently
allocated ranges, and the 'newzones' command for a complete list of
prototype vnum ranges.
 
Warning:  *Never* assign any vnums to a character who has another vnum
range assigned to them via 'aassign'.  Simply be sure to have the
character type 'aassign none' before assigning vnums to them.
 
Example:  massign Joseph 9000 9099
 
This will assign the vnum range from 9000 to 9099 for rooms to Joseph.
It is best to keep an areas object, room and mob range the same.
 
Be sure to always use 'checkvnums' to ensure the vnums you are going to
assign are clear.
 
See CHECKVNUMS, ZONES, NEWZONES, VNUMS
~

101 RAT~
Syntax: rat vnum1 vnum2 command [parameters]
 
Rat, or 'range at' is the at command with the added parameters of two
room vnums.  Assuming the vnums are valid, your 'at' command will be
executed in every room in the range you give.
 
Example: rat 100 110 redit flags 0
This will clear the room flags in all rooms from 100 to 110 inclusive.
~

101 RDELETE MDELETE ODELETE~
Syntax:  rdelete <vnum>
Syntax:  mdelete <vnum>
Syntax:  odelete <vnum>
 
These commands will allow you to delete a vnum's entry online.
They are not currently functional.
 
~

101 REBOOT SHUTDOWN WIZLOCK~
Syntax: reboot <nosave>
Syntax: shutdown <nosave>
Syntax: wizlock

REBOOT shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of sixty seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players
below level 101 may not log in.  Players who lose their links, however,
may reconnect.

If nosave is specified for reboot or shutdown, it will not automatically 
save all of the players.

~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, force points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~

101 RESTORE~
Syntax:  restore <victim>
Syntax:  restore all
 
Restore returns the victim to full hitpoints, force and movement.
 
Restore all can be done once per day (real time) by any Saint and above,
and will 'restore' every link-live player in the game.  Restore alls such
as this are limited to once every 6 hours, so if one Savior does one,
another cannot do one until 6 hours has passed, regardless of whether or
not they have not done one that day.
 
A Greater God or higher can do a restore all whenever they wish, and are
not constrained by the above limitations.
 
Use 'restoretime' to see when the last restore all was done.
 
See RESTORETIME
~

101 RESTORETIME~
Syntax:  restoretime
 
Displays the last 'restore all' performed by you, as well as the last
time a 'restore all' was done by anyone else.
 
See RESTORE
~

101 RESTRICT~
Syntax:  restrict <command> <level>
Syntax:  restrict <command> show

Used to restrict a command to a higher or lower level.  You cannot
rstrict a command you yourself cannot access.  Changes to a command's
level are not permanent unless they are saved using 'cedit save'.  A
command's level may also be changed using 'cedit'.
 
Use 'restrict <command> show' to see the level a command is currently
restricted to.
 
See CEDIT
~

101 RETIRE~
Syntax:  retire <immortal>
 
This command will 'retire' an active immortal and place them on the
wizlist under 'retired immortals'.  They will retain their level in
number only; they will be trusted to Savior level, and will have
access only to Savior-level commands.  They will not be able to see
logs of anyone higher than Savior, and their commands will be logged
as if they were a Savior.
 
A retired immortal can, however, manually be given a higher trust
level.
 
To bring an immortal out of retirement, simply 'retire immortal' again.
 
~

101 RETRAN~
Syntax: retran <player>
 
This command will return that player or mob to the room from which
you last transferred it from.
~

1 REVERT~
Syntax : revert

Reverts to your natural state.
~

0 RIP~
Syntax: rip <on/off>

The rip command will either enable or disable rip graphics.  Rip graphics 
will only work provided you are using a rip compatible terminal program.
~

101 RLIST~
Syntax: rlist
      :	rlist <first room>
      :	rlist <first room> <last room>

This command will list all of the prototype rooms in your area, when used 
with no arguments.  When used with a single argument it will list all 
rooms including and after the argument, and when used with two arguments, 
it will list all rooms including and between the two. 
 
*ND* means the room has no description. *NDH* means it has no hive
description. Easy enough. 
~

101 RMENU~
The menu commands are no longer in operation.

~

101 ROOMFLAG~
Toggling the ROOMFLAG option in config will allow you to see
all the flags which are set ON in a room.  It also causes the
room number to be displayed to you.  This command is very
useful when building new areas, as it allows you to see what a
room already has set.

1 SAVE~
Syntax:  Save
 
SAVE saves your character and its inventory; you must be at least second
level to save.  The system automatically saves one character approximately
minute, but with the high number of players usually online it may take
hours before your own is auto-saved.  For this reason, you should not
rely on auto-save to keep your character updated -- save frequently.
 
Type SAVE immediately after recovering your corpse, gaining experience or
a level in battle, getting new items, making purchases or repairs, etc.
 
Some objects (such as keys) may not be saved.
~

101 SAVEAREA LOADAREA~
Syntax: savearea
        loadarea

Savearea and loadarea will save or load your prototype area.
 
A God or higher may load or save any other prototype area by simply

max range for Aliens and Predators is 3 rooms with 30 Perception, while
Marines can scan up to 6 rooms with 30 Perception and the Eagle Eye skill
at Expert.

Scan will also show the distance each of the rooms are, to assist in
determining if a gun will fire that far.

0 SENTRY GUN GUNS 'SENTRY GUN' 'SENTRY GUNS'~
&zSentry Guns are a marine device capable of firing a lethal spray of
bullets up to 30 meters in a direction - every round. Incredibly potent,
capable of seeing through hide and cloak, they are one of the most feared
and dangerous pieces of marine equipment available.
 
Sentry Guns require the Electronics Skill (Advanced Rank) in order to
setup. You may only disable your own sentry gun. Guns will fire until 
depleted. They will only attack enemy targets, but you CAN be hit by the
spray. They will not fire at targets in the same room.
 
&BSetting up a Sentry Gun: 
 &w1) Deposit the Sentry Gun on the ground. 
 &w2) Type USE SENTRY to activate the Sentry Gun. 
 &w3) Use RELOAD SENTRY (Ammo) to load the weapon
 
&BDisabling a Sentry Gun:
 &w1) Type USE SENTRY to shut it back down. 
 &w2) Type GET SENTRY to pick it back up. 
 
&w&RNote: Requires Electronics Skill (Advanced Rank) to use. 
 
&BSentry Gun Statisitics: 
 &w30 meter firing range. 
 &wFires 50 round bursts every round.
 &wHolds 1500 rounds, or 30 shots to a clip. 
 &w125 Hitpoints, making them easy to kill.
 &wFires in Spray Patterns for maximum hits.

&w&BTaking out a Sentry Gun:
&zSentry Guns will not attack in the same room, so lunging into the room
will allow you to smash it. Grenades are also quite effective. Also,
Sentry Guns cannot fire up or down, so sometimes you can sneak up on it.
~

101 SETBOOT~
Syntax: setboot time <hour> <minute>
 	setboot manual <0|1>

The setboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from 
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by 
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18 
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s). 
~

1 SETMODE~
&zSyntax: SETMODE <new weapon mode> 
 
&BSINGLE &z(&WSingle-Round Firing&z): 
Single-fire mode is mostly used with large pistols and high-cycle time
weapons. It drains your AP gauge completely, but has a 20% accuracy bonus
to your shot, due to the extra time to aim and such. 
 
&BSEMI &z(&WSemi-Automatic Firing&z): 
Semi-automatic weapons fire only shot per attack, similar to the
single-round mode, except that it only drains 1 AP per shot. Its rapid
firing makes it ideal for Pulse Rifles and such though, and leaves enough
delay to cut back on spam. Also, 30% bonus to accuracy. 
 
&BBURST &z(&WBurst-Firing&z): 
Burst-fire weapons fire several rounds at a time, as designated by the
weapon. For instance, the VP70 Sidearm can fire 3 rounds in Burstmode.
This completely drains the AP Gauge and increases accuracy by 10%. When a
hit is made, the system randomly decides the number of rounds that hit. 
 
&BFULL &z(&WFully-Automatic Firing&z): 
Automatic weapons function exactly like Burst-firing weapons, except that
they tend to fire more rounds in Full-auto mode, and has an accuracy bonus
of 20%. Once again though, not all the rounds hit.

Swarming is an affect for aliens. When atleast one other alien is in 
your room or in adjacent rooms, you gain bonuses to your attack damage,
defense and regeneration abilities. This way, Aliens have an incentive to
work together in groups or swarms, to overcome the enemy. 
 
&BSwarm Bonuses:
 &w+10% to Natural Armor. 
 &w+10% damage to claw attacks. 
 &w+10% resistance to HP regeneration.

A Strength Check against both players gives you a chance to disarm them
also, causing them to drop their wielded weapons on the ground. 
 
&w&CWhen tackling, both the character and the victim lose their current
BLOCK setting, so its good for getting 'rines out of the way.

&W\Team"work`\, n. 
&zWork done by a number of associates, usually each doing a clearly defined
portion, but all subordinating personal prominence to the efficiency of
the whole; as, the teamwork of a football eleven or a gun crew. 
&R
Remember that, okay? Its extremely important, especially to Marines.
Without teamwork, your type will get STOMPED. Yeah, even with those
uber-powerful weapons, you'll get thrased. Anything powerful enough to do
serious damage is too slow to fend off more than one or two aliens at a
time. So, buy a Field Radio and join up with some Marines. Work together.
~

101 TIMECMD~
Syntax:  timecmd <command>
Example: timecmd mpstat <mob>

penatlies. The first penalty is an Experienc penatly. The second penalty
is a drop in your Team Kills meter. The meter can be seen in your SCORE,
under movement on the right hand side. If taht reachs 0, then you will
become frozen. This will last as long as it takes to put your meter back
up to the second number. So the higher rank you are, the more TKs you can
do, but the longer it will take to get unfrozen if you over-tk.

on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their

Syntax : Use (item)
 
Quite obviously lets you use an item.
~

101 USEPROG~
Syntax: opedit <object> <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]
 
The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke
 
When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (see 
MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.
~

101 USERS~
Syntax: users <host ip>
Syntax: users <playername>

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.
If used with an argument, it will show all users from that host ip.
Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.113, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.
Next is the user's character name, then the user's host address.
(Usually the IP number as name resolving is normally disabled.)

The FORCECLOSE command can be used to force a connect to close by its
descriptor number.

To enter the vents, you must first find a room with the vent flag, and then
use the command ENTER. Once inside, you can move from one access point to

1 YAUTJA PREDATOR~
&CYautja are a Nomadic, Matriarch society. For the most part they live
aboard ships, in packs. Packs are bands, of generally all males who may
stay together for a single hunt, or for years.

Yautja live to hunt, to claim torphies of what they consider worthy prey.
There have been few instances where 'worthy prey' who have slain Yautja
were deemed honorable enough to be left alone. A rare case, and only seen
from Elder Predators. Usually then are just seen as a better trophy, should
be best another Yautja hunter. Yautja hunt other Predators, to kill the
killer. His tropies become your own, a true accomplishment. This is their
interest in Kainde Amedha (Aliens).

Yautja exist in a primarily Matriarchal society. While the males are
generally nomadic, living aboard their ships, and carrying their
possesions, females claim territory, and generally run the politics of the
Yautja society. It's rare, but not unheard of to see a female warrior. It's
also worth noting, that Yautja females are considerably larger than the
males. The males are rarely shorter than seven foot tall.

1 YAUTJA2 PREDATOR2~
Yautja are governed stricly by a caste system. The strongest rule, and
number of trophies is a measure of strength. This caste system effects
living areas aboard ships. Young warriors usually live in the lower decks,
sleeping where they can fit themselves, while elder Yautja who have earned
their place are offered more luxurious accommdations. This is also how
ownership, or command of a ship is issued per pack. Yautja vessels stay in
service for centuries, and over time gain unique appearances between the
various packs roaming their hunting grounds. 

Weapons, the Yautja have engage someone in hand to hand combat. have
several melee weapons, and thrown weapons. The naginata and combi-spear
being a few of the more popular melee weapons. Smart discs, spearguns, and
plasma casters make up the main stay of the Predator armorment. Although
there are many other weapons reserved for a time of war. Armor is
similiar, although quite durable, it is usually limited to light or medium
armor for ease of mobility.  Heavy armor is reserved for all out war, on a
crowded battlefields or 'bug harvesting'. Predators, capture and use Queen
Aliens to lay eggs.  Which they pack into pods and drop on colonies, or
planets inhabited with creatures capable of being hosts. When someone
comes to investigate, they are infected, and we have an LV-426 situation
on our hands. As soon as someone is infected the pods report it back to
the vessel they were launched from, then it's time to begin to the hunt.
